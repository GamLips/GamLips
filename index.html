                            GamLips started as one programmer's idea who is
                            passionate about programming and gaming both. He
                            wanted to help new streamers to gain audience and he
                            believed that connecting with closest audience is
                            the key to connect with wider and broader audience.

                            Streaming gameplay on existing platform and gaining
                            audience is challenging these days and because of
                            that, so many talented gamers are not getting
                            attention and audience is not finding real
                            entertainer. With GamLips, we want to solve this
                            challenge and so we are looking for talented people
                            who can help us achieve this goal!
